# What is coading interview ?

when going on coading interview remember his things.
- prepare to succeed

- solve the problem conceptually first
    - first make a clear picture of the question
    - use the white board write down major points of the problem before outline the solution
    - break the problem into smaller ones . if their is limited time and the answer is not dome you can still be able to show chunks of code.

- employ appropriate tools
- optimize the solution

## Ex -------------------------------------------
famous example of socks colors...

yellow = 1
blue = 2 
red = 3 
green = 4
orange = 5

## array = [1,2,2,1,1,3,5,1,4,4]
## How many pairs of the same color?

## -----------------------------------------------

### Tips:-
- Existing structures minimize code required.
- always utilise existing approach rather than attempting to immpliment manual solutions.
- famalier with staple structures.
- review common sorting and searching argorithms before going on any interview.
