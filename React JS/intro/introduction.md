# React Introduction

## What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** used to build **user interfaces**, mainly for web applications where data changes frequently without reloading the page. It is commonly used to create **Single Page Applications (SPA)**.

React was developed by **Facebook (Meta)** to solve problems related to managing complex and dynamic user interfaces efficiently.

## Why React is Used

React is used to make UI development simpler, faster, and more scalable.

- Helps build **dynamic and interactive** user interfaces
- Follows a **component-based architecture**
- Improves performance using **Virtual DOM**
- Makes code **reusable and maintainable**
- Suitable for **large-scale applications**

## Key Features of React

### Component-Based Architecture
- UI is divided into small independent components
- Each component handles a specific part of the UI
- Components can be reused across the application

### JSX (JavaScript XML)
- Allows writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
- Makes UI code more readable
- Converted into normal JavaScript by React

### Virtual DOM
- React creates a virtual copy of the real DOM
- Only the changed parts are updated
- Improves application performance

### One-Way Data Binding
- Data flows from parent to child components
- Makes data flow predictable and easier to debug
